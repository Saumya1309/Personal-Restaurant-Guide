# Personal-Restaurant-Guide

The goal of the project was to design and build a mobile (iOS) application called ”Personal Restaurant Guide” that will help users to keep track of the restaurants they 
visit, rate them and share using email. Application is a standalone application (no back-end server is required). It runs on iOS selected device.
